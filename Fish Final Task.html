		Carp
	</h2>
	<p class="marginbot">
		The cypriniformes (family Cyprinidae) are traditionally grouped with the Characiformes,
		Siluriformes, and Gymnotiformes to create the superorder Ostariophysi, since these groups share
		some common features. These features include being found predominantly in fresh water and
		possessing Weberian ossicles, an anatomical structure derived from the first five anterior-most
		vertebrae, and their corresponding ribs and neural crests.
		The third anterior-most pair of ribs is in contact with the extension
		of the labyrinth and the posterior with the swim bladder. The function is poorly understood,
		but this structure is presumed to take part in the transmission of vibrations from the swim
		bladder to the labyrinth and in the perception of sound, which would explain why the Ostariophysi
		have such a great capacity for hearing.
		Carp have been domesticated for decoration in their koi form
		Most cypriniformes have scales and teeth on the inferior pharyngeal
		bones which may be modified in relation to the diet. Tribolodon is the only cyprinid genus
		which tolerates salt water. Several species move into brackish water but return to fresh water
		to spawn. All of the other cypriniformes live in continental waters and have a wide geographical
		range. Some consider all cyprinid fishes carp[by whom?], and the family Cyprinidae itself
		is often known as the carp family.
		In colloquial use, carp usually refers only to several larger cyprinid
		species such as Cyprinus carpio (common carp), Carassius carassius (Crucian carp),
		Ctenopharyngodon idella (grass carp), Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (silver carp), and
		Hypophthalmichthys nobilis (bighead carp).
		Carp have long been an important food fish to humans. Several species
		such as the various goldfish breeds and the domesticated common carp variety known as koi have
		been popular ornamental fishes. As a result, carp have been introduced to various locations,
		though with mixed results. Several species of carp are considered invasive species in the United
		States, and, worldwide, large sums of money are spent on carp control.
		At least some species of carp are able to survive for months with
		practically no oxygen (for example under ice or in stagnant, scummy water) by metabolizing
		glycogen to form lactic acid which is then converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The ethanol
		diffuses into the surrounding water through the gills.

	<h2 id="Pike">
		Pike
	</h2>
	<p class="marginbot">
		Northern pike are most often olive green, shading from yellow to white along the belly. The
		flank is marked with short, light bar-like spots and a few to many dark spots on the fins.
		Sometimes, the fins are reddish. Younger pike have yellow stripes along a green body; later,
		the stripes divide into light spots and the body turns from green to olive green. The lower
		half of the gill cover lacks scales, and it has large sensory pores on its head and on the
		underside of its lower jaw which are part of the lateral line system. Unlike the similar-looking
		and closely related muskellunge, the northern pike has light markings on a dark body background
		and fewer than six sensory pores on the underside of each side of the lower jaw.
		Drawing of northern pike
		A hybrid between northern pike and muskellunge is known as a tiger
		muskellunge (Esox masquinongy × lucius or Esox lucius × masquinongy,[6] depending on the sex
		of each of the contributing species). In the hybrids, the males are invariably sterile, while
		females are often fertile, and may back-cross with the parent species.[7] Another form of
		northern pike, the silver pike, is not a subspecies but rather a mutation that occurs in
		scattered populations. Silver pike, sometimes called silver muskellunge, lack the rows of spots
		and appear silver, white, or silvery-blue in color.[8] When ill, silver pike have been known
		to display a somewhat purplish hue; long illness is also the most common cause of male sterility.
		In Italy, the newly identified species Esox cisalpinus ("southern
		pike") was long thought to be a color variation of the northern pike, but was in 2011 announced
		to be a species of its own.

	<h2 id="Bass">
		Bass
	</h2>
	<p class="marginbot">
		Bass (/bæs/) is a common name shared by many species of fish. The term encompasses both
		freshwater and marine species, all belonging to the large order Perciformes or perch-like
		fishes. The word bass comes from Middle English bars, meaning 'perch'.
